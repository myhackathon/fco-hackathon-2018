# Datasource

We are publishing a list of all the British diplomats to work for us overseas from 1782-2015. You can also use any other data or information sources you can find from anywhere to help develop your ideas.

1. British Diplomatic Directory (1820-2005)
This dataset has been created and curated by Colin Mackie. Colin was Head of History at a Scottish secondary school from 1984-2001. In his spare time, Colin has been compiling a list of every diplomat ever to have worked for the FCO, including dates of birth and career postings. Collated from a number of different sources including Who’s Who and the official “Diplomatic Lists”, this is the largest existing set of data about the British Diplomatic Service in existence.
