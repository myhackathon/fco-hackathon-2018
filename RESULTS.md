1. Team: Political Learning Agents
Who? Shan (@xiaoshansun), Rainey (@womencancode), John (@john_sandall)
What? Data cleanup/geocoding + mapping diplomatic careers with kepler.gl + mapping human interaction networks from diplomatic interviews with NetworkX.
Where? https://github.com/john-sandall/fco-hackathon-2018/
Tools/stack used? Python, BeautifulSoup for XML parsing, Kepler for maps, NetworkX for networks.
Feedback? XML is quite gnarly to deal with, consistently formatted JSON would be great; modern dataviz tools are amazing if the data is in the right format; modern geocoding tools are not equipped to deal with historical regions!

2. Team: We ask the questions!
Who? Lewis (@instantiator)
What? A conversational bot for querying the diplomatic data set.
Where? Nowhere yet. I’ll push it to github some time.
Stack? MS Bot Framework, not cognitive services (eg. LUIS) yet though.
Lessons learned? I mean, XML. Don’t prepare a quarter of a Gb of pre-generated questions. Don’t wear insulating trainers. John is helpful. Cats are nice. VR is cool.
Favourite colour? Green. No, blue!
Average flight speed of a swallow? European or African?

3. Team: Declan and Kane
What?   A simple site allowing you to search through the alphabetical list of Diplomats and their
Where? Heroku https://bitbucket.org/KaneMorgan/man-in-havana/src/master/
Lessons Learned? Time management - keep, scoping out the dataset and then figuring out what we can do with it rather than forcing a solution. A lot (from Kane and others)

3. Team: Gordon
You can access an Excel document containing career paths of British Diplomats at 
https://github.com/igblackadder/fco-havana
Also at this address is an animation of diplomatic postings over time, and many (many) plots of diplomatic career paths across the globe.

4. Team: Trivial
I made something incredibly silly. It offers no value as a research tool, but could be extended to gamify the problem of bad data: I’m imagining an arcade-style standalone pub quiz machine that could live in the office of the official FCO historians.
It conforms to WCAG guidelines. I’ll formalise the docker containers and push those at a later date

5. Team: Who was our man in Havana?
Answers on a digital postcard (i.e. fun screenshots below!).

6. Team: British diplomat’s posting history over 200 years in action.
