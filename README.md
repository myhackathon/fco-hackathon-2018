1. British Diplomatic Directory (1820-2005)
This dataset has been created and curated by Colin Mackie. Colin was Head of History at a Scottish secondary school from 1984-2001. In his spare time, Colin has been compiling a list of every diplomat ever to have worked for the FCO, including dates of birth and career postings. Collated from a number of different sources including Who’s Who and the official “Diplomatic Lists”, this is the largest existing set of data about the British Diplomatic Service in existence.
XML tagged version of the dataset: https://static.history.state.gov/temp/bdd/british-diplomats-directory.xml
Dataset as PDF: http://www.gulabin.com/britishdiplomatsdirectory/pdf/britishdiplomatsdirectory.pdf

2. Diplomatic Lists (1862-1914)
