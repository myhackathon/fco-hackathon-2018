## Help us bring our diplomatic data to life!

We are publishing a list of all the British diplomats to work for us overseas from 1782-2015. You can also use any other data or information sources you can find from anywhere to help develop your ideas.   

We will be looking for bold and innovative ideas for navigating, using, and presenting the data, as well as designs which are easy to use and accessible for a wide range of people.
